The Stable Diffusion Cat Art Generator is a project that uses the Stable Diffusion model to create imaginative images based on textual prompts,
such as "A cat driving a car" or "Pablo Escobar cat."To get started, install the required packages using pip install diffusers==0.11.1 transformers scipy ftfy accelerate.
After setting up the Stable Diffusion pipeline, you can generate and save images or display them directly if you're using Google Colab.
For example, the code generates a single image with the prompt "A cat driving a car" and saves it as "cat_driving_car.png".
You can also create grids of images; the project includes a function to arrange multiple images into a grid format.
By adjusting the prompts and grid dimensions, you can generate a variety of creative outputs, such as a row of images depicting an "orange cat building a house" or a grid of "Pablo Escobar cat" images.
